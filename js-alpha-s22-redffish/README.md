# Homework: JavaScript α (2 Points)

This homework will introduce you to the syntax and semantics of the JavaScript language. We will be covering multiple topics, including element identification, manipulation, and styling, as well as logging, alerting, branching, looping, and even fetching from an API. By the end of this homework, you will have implemented the functionality supporting Badger Shop, and you will be able to improve the UI in JavaScript β.

Do **_not_** modify any files except for `script.js`. All questions are capable of being solved with [jQuery](https://api.jquery.com) or standard JavaScript syntax within `script.js`. Modifying any file outside of `script.js` will reduce your score by 1 point.

**Objective:** Complete each function inside of the `script.js` file with its desired functionality as described below. Do NOT modify `index.html`, `styles.css`, or add any additional files.
